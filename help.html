          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
          method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
          efficiency (or flow). <a href="/index.html">Join</a> leverages the
          principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in
          an intuitive, visual interface.
