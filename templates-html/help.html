            <p>What is Join?</p>
            <span><a href="/index.html">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group
                of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Academy.</span>

                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <a href="/index.html">Join</a> leverages the
                principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

                            Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New Contact", and fill in the required information.
                            Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the

                            in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,

                            a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
